# Android/iOS specific (User modified native code, so we KEEP android/ios folders but ignore build artifacts)
# app/android/ and app/ios/ are NOT ignored because we have custom config like google-services.json (the structure)
# However, we must ignore the actual secrets if they are not meant to be committed.
# But google-services.json is often committed in private repos. Use caution.
# For now, we ignore the root google-services if it's considered secret, but usually it's required for build.
